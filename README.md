# Analyzing International-Breweries Data using SQL Queries
## Project Overview
The objective of this SQL project is to perform comprehensive analyses on the international breweries data spanning a three-year duration. The goal is to provide actionable insights that will facilitate informed decision-making, ultimately aimed at maximizing profit and minimizing losses to the lowest possible extent. Through meticulous examination of the dataset, the project aims to uncover patterns, trends, and key performance indicators within the brewery operations, enabling stakeholders to optimize strategies, enhance efficiency, and make data-driven decisions for sustained financial success

## Data Cleaning
Before delving into the analysis, the raw data sourced from the International Breweries Data Source underwent a meticulous data cleaning process. This crucial step was taken to guarantee accuracy and reliability, involving tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing inconsistent data points


## Findings and Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following insights were discovered:
- Francophone countries made more profit in the lat 3 years
- Ghana generated the highest profit of $7,144,070 in 2019
- The highest profit of 38,503,320 was made in 2017
- Senegal sold the most beer- Hero beer
  


## Dependencies
